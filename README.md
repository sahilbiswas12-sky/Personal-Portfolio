Personal Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, a modern, responsive, and interactive platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as a full-stack developer.

‚ú® Features

Responsive Design: The layout is fully adaptive and provides an optimal viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktops.

Dynamic Hero Section: A typing animation effect dynamically highlights my various roles and skills, creating a memorable first impression.

Dark/Light Mode: Users can toggle between a sleek, dark theme and a clean, light theme for personalized comfort.

Interactive Sections: Sections for About, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact are designed to be engaging and easy to navigate.

Project Showcase: A filterable gallery of projects with dynamic modals to display detailed information for each project, including key features and technologies.

Experience Timeline: A clean and organized timeline presents my professional and academic journey.

Contact Form: A functional contact form powered by EmailJS allows visitors to get in touch directly without revealing personal email credentials on the frontend.

Smooth Animations: Subtle CSS and JavaScript animations, including a custom cursor effect and on-scroll reveals, enhance the user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

HTML5: The foundational markup for structuring the website content.

CSS3: For styling, including custom properties (variables), gradients, and animations.

JavaScript (ES6+): Provides all the interactive functionality, from the typing effect to the form submission.

Font Awesome: Used for a wide range of professional icons.

Vanilla Tilt.js: A lightweight library for the smooth 3D parallax hover effect on cards.

Particles.js: For the interactive particle background on the hero section.

EmailJS: A service that allows sending emails directly from the client side using a custom API key without a server.

üöÄ How to Run Locally

This is a static website, so setting it up is very simple.

Clone the repository:

Git clone  https://sahilbiswas12-sky.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-portfolio-repo

Open index.html:

Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the portfolio.

Note: The provided code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single index.html file for simplicity. In a larger project, it's best practice to separate these into dedicated .html, .css, and .js files for better organization and maintainability.
